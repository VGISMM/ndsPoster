The proposed system is evaluated on 4,992 day and 3,933 night time frames. In Table \ref{systemOverview::derivedSemantics:Results} the results are seen, where GT is the \textit{ground truth} of events manually labeled and SO is the \textit{system output}. The proposed system have an overall precision of 0.78 and recall of 0.72.

In Figure \ref{systemOverview::distanceToVehicle} an example of the output from the system is seen. %This specific image is an example of the overlapping
The new NDS event introduced with this work is the distance to vehicle in front of the ego-vehicle, which is measured using stereo-vision. In Figure \ref{systemOverview::distanceToVehicle} an example of this is seen where the distance of 12.6 meter is written in blue just above the center. This distance measure is also visible in Figure \ref{systemOverview::occludedVehicleDetected}.
