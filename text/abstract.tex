In order to understand dangerous situations in the driving environment, Naturalistic driving studies (NDS) are conducted by collecting and analyzing data from sensors looking inside and outside of the car. The process of manually analyzing the overwhelming amount of data that is generated in such studies is very comprehensive. This paper proposes a method for data reduction in NDS based on stereo vision during day- and nighttime. The developed system can automatically register six NDS events mainly related to intersections. Additionally, this paper proposes a new drive event relying on the extra dimension provided by stereo vision, where the minimum distance from the ego vehicle to other vehicles directly in front is detected.
In total six drive events are selected on the basis of them being problematic to detect automatically using conventional monocular computer vision. 
Finally the proposed system is evaluated on day- and nighttime data, and the result is a quantified drive analysis report based on the six events. The proposed system have an overall precision of 0.9375 and an overall recall of 0.71, which is considered a useful for data reduction in NDS.
