The use of stereo-vision is considered beneficial, especially in scenarios with partly occluded cars, in such cases most monocular systems will fail. It is considered that providing distance information from the ego vehicle to surroundings provide useful information with regard to drive patterns before and during a crash or near crash. The system proved to work in both day and nighttime conditions with a limited drop in overall performance for the night scenarios.\\
Future work includes looking at additional events where stereo-vision can be utilized, evaluating on more data, and optimizing the system to work in real-time.
