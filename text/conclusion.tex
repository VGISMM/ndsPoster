The use of stereo-vision is considered beneficial, especially in scenarios with partly occluded cars, in such cases most monocular systems will fail. It is considered that providing distance information from the ego vehicle to surroundings provide useful information with regard to drive patterns before and during a crash or near crash. The system proved to work in both day and nighttime conditions with a limited drop in overall performance for the night scenarios. The proposed system have an overall precision of 0.9375 and an overall recall of 0.71, which is considered useful for data reduction in NDS. Future work may include looking at additional NDS events where stereo-vision can be utilized.
