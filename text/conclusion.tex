The use of stereo-vision is considered beneficial, especially in scenarios with partly occluded cars, in such cases most monocular systems will fail. Distance information from the ego vehicle to the surroundings provide useful information with regard to drive patterns before and during a crashes. 
\begin{itemize}
\item Introduction of a novel stereo based critical event analysis approach.
\item Experimental analysis shows very promising detection, trajectory and event classification rates.
\item Ongoing research involves extensive experimental validation and a day and night time critical event detection module for public use.
\end{itemize}

%The system proved to work in both day and nighttime conditions with a limited drop in overall performance for the night scenarios.\\
%Future work includes looking at additional events where stereo-vision can be utilized, evaluating on more data, and optimizing the system to work in real-time.
