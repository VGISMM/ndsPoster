We introduce a stereo-vision based system that enables automatic event detection based on detection and tracking of vehicles in scenarios that usually would be highly problematic for monocular detectors. The purpose is to provides insight into patterns and behaviors of drivers during near-crashes and crashes. The proposed system will be limited to only handling a handful of events, which especially benefit from the extra dimension gained with stereo-vision. The events considered in this paper are illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:introduction:semantics}. Monocular systems usually have problems dealing with occlusions since they detect based on appearance, which require a large amount of training data for dealing the many possible viewpoints and changing light conditions.

Our contributions are:
\begin{itemize}
\item Using stereo-vision for automatic event detection in both day and nighttime, with focus on intersections (Figure \ref{fig:introduction:semantics:c}, \ref{fig:introduction:semantics:d}, \ref{fig:introduction:semantics:e}, \ref{fig:introduction:semantics:f}).
\item Introducing a new event: Average number of vehicles in front of the ego vehicle. (Figure \ref{fig:introduction:semantics:a}).
\item Introducing a new event: Average distance to vehicles directly in front of the ego vehicle. (Figure \ref{fig:introduction:semantics:b}).
\end{itemize}
